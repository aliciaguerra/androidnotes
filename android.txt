Describe activites.
Activities are what you refer to as the window to the user interface. Just as you create windows in order to
display output or to ask for an input in the form of dialog boxes, activites play the same role, though it 
may not always be in the form of a user interface.

What are intents?
Intents display notification messages to the user from within the Android enabled device. It can be used to
alert the user of a particular state that has occured. Users can be made to respond to the intents.

Differentiate activities from services.
Activities can be closed, or terminated anytime the user wishes. On the other hand, services are designed to
run behind the scenes, and can run independently. Most services run continuously, regardless of whether there 
are certain or no activities being executed.

What are contianers?
Containers, as the name itself implies, hold objects and widgets together, depending on which specific items
are needed and in what particular arrangement that is wanted. Containers may hold labels, fields, buttons, or even
child containers as examples.

What is orientation?
Orientation, which can be used as setOrientation(), dictates if the LinearLayout is represented as a row or column.
Values are set as either horizontal or vertical.
